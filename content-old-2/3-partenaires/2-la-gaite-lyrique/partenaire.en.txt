La Gaîté lyrique is cultural institution in Paris that specialises in emerging forms of digital culture and the dialogue between art, technology, research and society. As part of a new generation of ‘third places’ for exploration , La Gaîté lyrique demystifies culture, technology and knowledge for adults and children alike, in a fun, friendly atmosphere. 
La Gaîté lyrique organises exhibitions, concerts, conferences, projections and workshops – events that bring people together and chart a path through the complex flow of information and figures that make up our world. The institution approaches contemporary artistic expression from insightful, critical, offbeat and entertaining angles, as a means of thinking critically about the impact of technology and development decisions in our ever-changing society.
Education in digital technology is viewed as vital to empowering citizens at La Gaîté Lyrique, which explores thoughtful approaches to living, doing things together and confronting the changes at hand proactively.
The establishment has received 1,300,000 visitors since opening in March 2011, and its hybrid business model represents an innovative step forward in the French culture sector.
