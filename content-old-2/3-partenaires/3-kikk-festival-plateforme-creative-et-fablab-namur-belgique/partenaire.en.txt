Text: 

The KIKK association has been building bridges between the worlds of art, culture, science and technology since 2011, by organising events, supporting the creation of artwork and initiating educational projects. Working with the public, companies and students, the association champions the idea that art, culture, technological innovation and creativity are catalysts for future economic development.
Every year, KIKK holds its namesake international festival, which explores creative and digital culture through exhibitions, conferences, workshops and an innovation market. The festival reaches across disciplines to connect artists, makers entrepreneurs and developers. The festival expanded in 2012 with the birth of Little.KIKK: programming for children that includes introductory and creation workshops in art and technology, as well as galleries of works for young audiences. 
KIKK is also a founding partner in the Trakk creative hub & Fab Lab and the Smart Gastronomy Lab, the first Belgian living lab to approach gastronomy from a technological standpoint.
