Recent upheavals in the techno-scientific and intellectual milieus are reshaping our worldview to mind-boggling proportions. Computers, those fantastic tools that come without instructions, have transformed our lives by changing our points of reference, which used to be placed on the axes of time and space. Whether you grew up with computers or not, at times we all feel incredibly small before the progress they are helping to achieve and the possibilities they have in store. Intrigued by the promise of an extraordinary journey that could lead in any direction, Capitaine futur is embarking on a breathtaking plunge into the depths of the computer, an everyday supermachine. Behind the screen, his trajectory is as labyrinthine as our web browsing and as elusive as a fleeting thought. Interspersed with fantastic and mysterious stopovers, the journey propels Capitaine futur into rapids swirling at increasing speeds, to the heart of open sources and toward intoxicating cascades of information.

**Letter of Capitaine futur**

*Dear friends, 
I’m leaving my planet to embark on a new expedition.
It’s taking me into the depths of the computer, where the landscapes defy proportion, scale, and the laws of gravity. Aboard my ship, the Capsulo, I am plunging behind the screen to solve the mystery of our daily perceptions, for as you know, the unknown is often right under your nose. Follow me without further delay on this amazing journey. Make your own way through these unfathomable lands. Touch the spider web and the shimmering vastness, watch the scales tip and observe that which is tiny unite with infinity. Listen to the ingenious explanations of experts at the frontiers of physics, knowledge and imaginable space. Dance with the spirits of nature, follow the lines and perspectives that are shaping our future joys.
Capitaine futur*
