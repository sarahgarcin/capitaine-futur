Creative, polymorphic and versatile platform, the KIKK association explores digital cultures. Founded in Namur in 2011, it is involved in building bridges and ties to the areas of arts, science, culture and technology. KIKK transforms and densifies space. With a free spirit and mad audacity, KIKK fits between technological innovation and creativity, and refreshes - in recess - the foundations of an economy to be reinvented. KIKK is a space ship which organises events, supports the production of artistic work and is involved in the emergence of new projects.
