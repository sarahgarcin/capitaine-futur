## BACKGROUND
The march of technology continues to blur the lines between artistic disciplines. New interactive, tactile and aesthetic possibilities emerge. Grouped under the umbrella term “media art”, these forms are expanding the definition of art to include practices that combine and transform prototypes, relationships, processes and resources. Media art bears witness to the monumental changes underway in contemporary society by harnessing the latest in research and technical advances, experimenting with and subverting technology that is still unstable in order to develop future practices and raise questions about those in use today. *Les Voyages de Capitaine futur* explores the artistic languages and creative processes that have emerged from media and the digital world. Digital technology is not only a technological tool; it is also a path to emotions, collective narratives, and knowledge.

## OPEN CALL
Three proposals selected from the entries will be produced and presented at several international events, venues and festivals in 2018 and 2019 to an audience of children and families.
 
**Fields of creation**
The call for proposals is open to all artistic forms and practices that use, subvert, investigate and experiment with media critically, creatively and in a sensory way, including the fields of artificial intelligence, art & science, robotics, bioart, biohacking, machine learning, smart objects, up/recycling, interactive design and speculative design.
  
**For whom?** 
Artists from all countries are welcome to submit proposals.
 
**Theme: “Supernatural: stories of worlds to come”.**
The theme invites artists to offer their perspective on the technological, dematerialized, complex environments and ubiquitous machines that have become natural elements in our lives. A host of singular species coexist in this new world: virtual animals, mutant plants, electronic viruses, insatiable computers, memory rocks, tentacular networks, autodidact algorithms, domestic robots, cybernetic forests and more. This organic, composite, living world requires us to rethink how we live, communicate and use our senses. To explore the transformations of our era, we need a plethora of new skills, freshly attuned senses, emotions and forms of thought outside the bounds of rationality. Is this an intermediate stage of natural evolution or a ‘big bang’ of singularities? What new configurations are in store? What tools must we craft to survive, experience, adjust to and negotiate these new types of coexistence? 

**Supernatural: stories of worlds to come** aims to elicit poetic visions, narrative approaches and fictional tales that recount a land where humans are no longer central and undergo a metamorphosis upon contact with heterogeneous beings. We are entering an era of hybrid ecology: AI as landscape, networks as biotopes, data as organisms and media as humus. Where do we go from here?
