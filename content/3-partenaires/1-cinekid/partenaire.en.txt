**INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL FOR CHILDREN**
**[Amsterdam, Netherlands]**
For the past 30 years, Cinekid has organised an annual film, television and new media festival in Amsterdam and 40 other Dutch cities, attracting 60,000 visitors to its market for professionals, conferences and masterclasses. At its MediaLab, Cinekid explores trends in audiovisual technology, art, games, writing and media, with a focus on anticipating future developments, uses and opportunities. 
The Cinekid MediaLab engages children in active, creative discovery of media through exhibitions on topics at the crossroads of art, science and technology, which feature interactive installations, games, applications and workshops that offer a window into leading-edge research. Recognising the role of collaboration, technological chance and processes in learning, the MediaLab developed the “Art, Research and Development” (AR&D) module, which spotlights sector stakeholders, studios and multidisciplinary laboratories by inviting artists to create installations that share their research with a broader audience and taking part in a robust network of designers and organisations across Europe and farther afield.
